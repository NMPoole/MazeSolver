# MazeSolver

A classic project for most Computer Science students!
This project allows a user to generate and solve mazes by
visualising the process of different search algorithms 
(e.g., breadth-first, A*, etc.).

This project had multiple intentions:

1. Review previous concepts related to search algorithms, both unweighted and weighted with heuristics.
2. Further learn and practice web development with Javascript, namely by learning how to create good-looking interfaces and animations.
3. Practice the ability to visualise my work - previous projects are underwhelming in what they achieve due to the CLI.
