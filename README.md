# MazeSolver

A classic project for most Computer Science students!
This project allows a user to generate and solve mazes by
visualising the process of different search algorithms 
(e.g., breadth-first, A*, etc.).

**Project Goals:**

1. Review previous concepts related to search algorithms, both unweighted and weighted with heuristics.
2. Further learn and practice web development with Javascript, namely by learning how to create good-looking interfaces and animations.
3. Practice the ability to visualise my work - previous projects are underwhelming in what they achieve due to the CLI.

**Motivation for the project:**

Perusing YouTube one day, I found myself looking at Dev Blogs for people's personal projects
and came across this video by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&ab_channel=Cl%C3%A9mentMihailescu).
Immediately, I thought to myself, "I've done this before extensively, better even, with more algorithms and research and 
analysis. However, my project work doesn't look this impressive". Indeed, my university work is impressive in the theory
it explores, but the average recruiter, employer, or fellow developer wouldn't be able to tell. CLIs are lack luster at 
showing of what a project does! Thus began my journey of marrying two key aspects: the review of previous theory from my degree, and 
learning web development and design to show this theory off.
